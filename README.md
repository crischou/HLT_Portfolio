## HW1
Program reads a csv file containing a list of employees and other identifiers. Validates input and then prints out list of employees.
Run on commandline with "python file.py <filepath.csv>"
Python has many functions that are easy to use for processing text. The regex functions are easy and intuitive, and there are also many additional libraries that make text processing in Python very simple. Addtionaly, the language just feels smooth to code in. 
This assignment was a good review for text processing in Python because it covered many scenarios and had lots of input validation. I also learned a bit more on how to use the Python Dictionaries datastructure.

## Summary
Through this course, I learned a great deal about NLP techniques. I learned about staple NLP techniques such as tf-idf, NER, and term frequency. In addition, I also learned alot about information extraction and data parsing which not only helped with this course but can be applicable to general machine learning and data analysis. The pace at which this field changes is very intimidating; it feels that not so long ago ChatGPT was just starting to catch eyes, and now GPT-4 has already been released for early access. I'd love to take opportunities that would continue using the skills from this course in the future, whether that be for employment or research.
